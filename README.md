# Project Background
ShopEasy, an online retail business, is experiencing a decline in customer engagement and conversion rates despite launching several new marketing campaigns. The company has invested in marketing, but the returns have not met expectations. Additionally, they need to identify customer pain points, which are assumed to be contributing to the low conversion rate. As a data analyst, my goal is to conduct a detailed analysis to identify areas for improvement in their marketing strategies. This will help enhance engagement, increase conversion rates, and improve customer satisfaction scores.

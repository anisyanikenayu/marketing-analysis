# Project Background
ShopEasy, an online retail business, is experiencing a decline in customer engagement and conversion rates despite launching several new marketing campaigns. The company has invested in marketing, but the returns have not met expectations. Additionally, they need to identify customer pain points, which are assumed to be contributing to the low conversion rate. As a data analyst, my goal is to conduct a detailed analysis to identify areas for improvement in their marketing strategies. This will help enhance engagement, increase conversion rates, and improve customer satisfaction scores.

# Insight Deep-Dive
### Customer Engagement Breakdown:

- Based on the marketing campaign data from 2023 to 2025, the overall total engagement has steadily declined year over year, starting at **5 million in 2023**, with a growth rate of **-0.47 in 2024** and **-0.67 in 2025**. CTR follows a similar downward trend, reaching **19.7%**, which is still considered good. However, by **2025, the CTR dropped below 10%**. Although engagement saw occasional increases in **February, April, and September 2023**, these fluctuations did not significantly impact the CTR. It may be necessary to **evaluate the campaign targets** and implement a **stronger call-to-action** to improve engagement and conversion rates.

- Based on content type, blog content receives more views and interactions compared to social media and video. However, in contrast, CTR on social media and video is more efficient than on blogs. Overall, total reactions (likes and clicks) account for less than half of the total views, averaging around 25% of total views. While this is a good rate, there is still room for improvement. This indicates that the current content strategy is not fully effective in maximizing engagement.

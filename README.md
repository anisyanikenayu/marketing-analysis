# Project Background
ShopEasy, an online retail business, is experiencing a decline in customer engagement and conversion rates despite launching several new marketing campaigns. The company has invested in marketing, but the returns have not met expectations. Additionally, they need to identify customer pain points, which are assumed to be contributing to the low conversion rate. As a data analyst, my goal is to conduct a detailed analysis to identify areas for improvement in their marketing strategies. This will help enhance engagement, increase conversion rates, and improve customer satisfaction scores.

# Executive Summary
ShopEasy has experienced a steady decline in customer engagement and conversion rates from 2023 to 2025, with total engagement dropping and CTR falling below 10% by 2025. While blog content generates more views, social media and video achieve higher CTR, indicating inefficiencies in content strategy. Additionally, conversion rates remain low (9.7% on average), with fluctuations likely due to poor product targeting and inconsistent campaign execution. Seasonal trends also impact performance, as seen in Q1 and Q4 product demand mismatches. Lastly, customer satisfaction data shows a 3.69/5 average rating, with opportunities for improvement in mid-range feedback. Addressing these gaps through refined targeting, optimized content strategies, and stronger call-to-action approaches is crucial to reversing declining engagement and boosting conversions.

# Insight Deep-Dive
### Customer Engagement Breakdown:
- Based on the marketing campaign data from 2023 to 2025, the overall total engagement has steadily declined year over year, starting at 5 million in 2023, with a growth rate of -0.47 in 2024 and -0.67 in 2025. CTR follows a similar downward trend, reaching 19.7%, which is still considered good. However, by 2025, the CTR dropped below 10%. Although engagement saw occasional increases in February, April, and September 2023, these fluctuations did not significantly impact the CTR. It may be necessary to evaluate the campaign targets and implement a stronger call-to-action to improve engagement and conversion rates.

- Based on content type, blog content receives more views and interactions compared to social media and video. However, in contrast, CTR on social media and video is more efficient than on blogs. Overall, total reactions (likes and clicks) account for less than half of the total views, averaging around 25% of total views. While this is a good rate, there is still room for improvement. This indicates that the current content strategy is not fully effective in maximizing engagement.

### Conversation Rate Breakdown:
- Based on the graph, the conversion rate fluctuates yearly. The patterns in 2023 and 2024 are quite similar but differ significantly from 2025. However, from Q3 to Q4, the 2024 pattern starts to resemble 2025. The average conversion rate from 2023 to 2025 stands at 9.7%, which is relatively low. These fluctuations may be due to misalignment in product targeting, resulting in ineffective communication of customer needs during specific quarters.

- Based on the list of products with CTR and Conversion Rate per quarter, some products achieve a high CTR but a very low conversion rate. For example, in Q1, running shoes had a CTR of 26.4 but a conversion rate of only 6.05. Conversely, there are cases where CTR of ski boots is not particularly high, such as 20.3 in Q1, but the conversion rate reached 35.0. This distinction is likely due to customer demand aligning with seasonal needs, such as Q1 and late Q4 leading into winter, while the team has yet to fully optimize product targeting campaigns. Additionally, both CTR and conversion rates tend to decline from Q1 to Q4, as campaigns lack consistency, missing key moments that could have captured attention and driven sales.

### Customer Satisfaction Breakdown:
- Based on customer satisfaction data, with 1,363 ratings and reviews from 100 unique customers the average overall rating is 3.69 out of 5 Overall, positive reviews make up the largest proportion compared to negative ones, with most ratings falling between 4 and 5 However, there are also areas for improvement, particularly in the "somewhat positive" and "somewhat negative" feedback categories, which are placed in the 2 to 3 rating range.

# Recommendation 
- Enhance customer engagement: Evaluate and rearrange the content strategy to counter declining views and low interaction by experimenting with engaging content. Leverage popular or viral topics as references while incorporating storytelling and emotion to create a sense of urgency for customers, enhancing engagement in videos and user-generated content. Boost CTR by implementing bold call-to-action strategies in blogs and social media. Plan content quarterly and prepare a backup strategy (Plan B) to mitigate unexpected drops in engagement during campaigns. Conduct regular campaign evaluations and ensure each campaign is targeted to specific customer segments for more efficient advertising.  

- Increase conversion rate: When creating a campaign, focus on products that align with seasonal demands and leverage key moments, such as summer activities and winter demand, to maximize sales opportunities. For example, in Q1, which corresponds to winter in most regions of Europe, America, and parts of Asia, product selection should cater to customer needs. Additionally, utilize historical engagement and conversion data to identify winning products for future campaigns and optimize performance.  

- Improve customer satisfaction: To address pain points, further investigate why customers have given somewhat positive and somewhat negative feedback, and focus on resolving these concerns. Then, follow up with the customers to reassess if the issue has been successfully addressed, aiming to achieve a rating of 4 or 5.
